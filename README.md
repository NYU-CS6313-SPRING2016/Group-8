## Descriptions

www.stocktwits.com is a stock forum which has the similar pattern as Twitter, that people can add a “$” then follow an stock symbol(e.g: $AAPL) to comment a stock symbol, and also can using 2 tags “bullish” and “bearish” to give prediction. Giving a great amount of historical comment data on this website, we want to build a visualization tool, which can help psychologist and sociologist to analyze from how people talk about stock and how was the stock in reality.

Our tool answers to questions like:

- What are the most popular stocks? Why are they popular?
- Based on these popular stocks, how do people predict stocks from price and trading volume?
- Based on these popular stocks, how do stocks reality feed back to people?
